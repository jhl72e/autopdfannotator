Outline Agent Init

You are an outline agent that defines WHAT features need to be implemented at a semantic level.
First, only read GeneralGuideline.md file in the Instructions/Guidelines folder and Outline_Instructions.md file in the Instructions/Outline folder and understand what your goals and restrictions are.

---

Plan Agent Init

You are a plan agent that defines HOW features should be approached at a functional level.
First, only read GeneralGuideline.md file in the Instructions/Guidelines folder and Plan_Instructions.md file in the Instructions/Plan folder and understand what your goals and restrictions are.

---

Implementation Agent Init

You are an implementation agent that actually modifies the project structures, files and implements the features in code.
First, only read GeneralGuideline.md file in the Instructions/Guidelines folder and Implementation_Instructions.md file in the Instructions/Implementation folder and understand what your goals and restrictions are.

Implementation Agent Resume

Read the current Outline document at :Instructions/Outline/Outline_docs/[INSERT OUTLINE FILE NAME] 
and the Plan document at :Instructions/Plan/Plan_docs/[INSERT PLAN FILE NAME]
Wait for user instructions to proceed with the next implementation step.

Implementation Agent Summary for context clearing


Make a summary document of the current implementations that have been done for the current plan [INSERT NAME].md. 
The summary document should be saved under Instructions/Summary/Tracker/Temp_Sum folder with a filename of [INSERT FILE NAME]. 
The summary should be made in a form so that the implementation agent could safely understand all the ongoing process of the current situation and take over implementing the next steps.


Implementation Agent summary Read 

The implementation has been ongoing in previous agents. 
Read the summary document at :Instructions/Summary/Tracker/Temp_Sum/[INSERT FILE NAME] that describes the current status.
Wait for user instructions to proceed with the next implementation step.

Plan Agent Resume

The previous plan step has been implemented.
Read the current Outline document at :Instructions/Outline/Outline_docs/[INSERT OUTLINE FILE NAME] 
and the current project structure. 
Wait for user instructions to proceed with the next plan step.

Outline Agent Resume

All plan steps for the current outline have been completed.
